## Conclusion

The analysis shows that PwC has made progress in diversity hiring and promotions, especially at the Junior Officer level where female promotions slightly outpaced males. However, certain areas need attention:

1. High turnover in Finance indicates retention challenges.

2. Directors’ long promotion timelines suggest limited upward mobility.

3. Balanced performance ratings across genders indicate fair evaluation practices.

4. The workforce is young (20–29 years), so retention and career growth strategies should focus on this age group.

This project highlights the importance of data-driven HR strategies to ensure fairness, inclusion, and long-term employee engagement.
